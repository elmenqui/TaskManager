# ToBe - TaskManager

Welcome to my very first JAVA program, ToBeList. 
ToBeList is a simple, text based to-do-list programme.  

In TobeList you will be able to crate a task that contains 
a task title, due date, status and project. You can also 
display a collection of tasks that can be sorted both by 
date and project.It support the ability to add, edit, 
mark as done, and remove tasks; as well as load and 
save task list to file.

## Operating instructions

## Credits and acknowledgments

As a novice coder, I am using a lot of code snippets found in differente sources like:

 - StackExchange
 - StackOverFlow
 - GeeksforGeeks
 
 I am also using the educational projects found in Michael KÃ¶lling and David J. Barnes
book "Objects First with Java": chapter 4,5,8 & 14
 
I want to thank Novare Potential and KTH for their Software Development Academy because I would not have 
the courage to upload any code made if it was not a requiremnet for the programme :)
